# 📊 Financial Dashboard about Brazilian Stocks with Streamlit
## 🎯 Objective
To graphically represent the price behavior of Brazilian stocks from 2010 to 2024 in an interactive way.
## 📝 Abstract
Interactive financial dashboard developed in Python, focusing on front-end data applications, using Streamlit for interface construction and visualizations.

The application consumes financial market data through the yfinance library, performs processing and manipulation with Pandas and NumPy, and uses native modules such as datetime and math for calculations, temporal organization, and financial metrics. The data is presented in a clear, interactive, and analysis-oriented way.

The project was developed in Visual Studio Code (VSCode), following best practices for code structuring, readability, and maintenance, simulating a real-world professional application scenario.
